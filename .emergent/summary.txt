The AI engineer has focused on building a comprehensive JEE/NEET/EAMCET exam portal. Initial setup involved clarifying AI provider API keys and Google OAuth credentials. The core infrastructure, including AI integration (Gemini primary), authentication, and database models, was set up first. Significant progress was made on the frontend, creating essential pages like Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, QuickExamSetup, ExamInterface, ExamResults, and Profile, along with React contexts for Auth and Exam.

The most challenging aspect, AI question generation, was initially problematic (incomplete generation) but has been largely resolved through a chunked approach, robust error handling, and better model configuration. However, Google authentication remains a pending issue. The latest user instruction is to change EMCET to EAMCET throughout the application and finally fix the Google authentication, which is currently the immediate focus.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a student-only JEE/NEET/EAMCET Exam Practice Portal from scratch, focusing on zero errors, single delivery, complete functionality, and ultra-high performance.
**Core Features:**
*   **Authentication:** Student registration (full details, class, target exam, email verification, optional profile pic), login (email/phone, remember me, forgot password, Google social login), and profile management.
*   **Quick Exam Setup:** A one-page interface to select exam type (JEE Main, NEET, EAMCET Engineering, EAMCET Medical, Custom Mix), subjects (auto-populate), number of questions, time duration, and difficulty level.
*   **AI-Powered Question Generation:** Dynamic MCQ generation with multi-provider integration (Google Gemini Pro primary, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude fallbacks, ultimate fallback to pre-generated bank). Guarantees zero repetition, balanced difficulty, and topic coverage. Supports SCA, MCA, NAT, Assertion-Reason, and EAMCET-specific question types with quality assurance.
*   **Immersive Exam Interface:** Distraction-free full-screen mode, dark theme, countdown timer, question palette with color-coded status, instant navigation, mark for review, auto-save, and EAMCET-specific sections.
*   **Advanced Results & Analytics:** Instant score, subject/topic-wise breakdown, percentile, time analysis, detailed explanations, strength/weakness identification, and visual performance charts.
*   **Student Dashboard:** Performance overview, quick actions (resume exams, review results), study analytics, and motivational elements.
*   **Ultra-Modern Design:** Futuristic aesthetics with glassmorphism, dynamic gradients, 3D cards, neon accents, advanced animations (Framer Motion), and mobile-first responsive design.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
*   Initial project setup with React frontend and FastAPI backend.
*   Database schemas for , , and  models defined.
*   Backend AI integration with Gemini Pro (primary) using  library, including chunked question generation, error handling, and a progress tracking endpoint.
*   Frontend structure with core pages: Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, QuickExamSetup, ExamInterface, ExamResults, Profile.
*   React contexts for  and  created.
*   Basic Google OAuth button component added (though functionality is still problematic).
*   Corrected the issue of incomplete AI question generation by implementing chunking and better error handling.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack MERN-like Architecture:** React (Frontend), Node.js/Express.js (Backend - but FastAPI chosen for this task), MongoDB (Database).
- **AI Integration:** Multi-provider fallback system for question generation (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) using  library.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with refresh tokens, Google OAuth.
- **State Management:** Zustand (for React).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system.
- **Performance:** Caching (Redis), CDN, code splitting, image optimization.
- **Error Handling:** Frontend error boundaries, API error responses, retry logic, fallbacks.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This is the main backend FastAPI application. It handles API routes, database interactions, and orchestrates AI question generation.
    *   **Changes:** Initially set up with basic routes for authentication and exam creation. Modified extensively to integrate the  library for Gemini AI, implement chunked question generation, add error handling, and include a progress tracking endpoint (). MongoDB models for , , and  were defined here.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    *   **Changes:**  and  were added to support AI and Google OAuth functionalities.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** The main React component that defines the overall structure and routing of the frontend application.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to integrate  and  providers and set up routing for all major application pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, QuickExamSetup, ExamInterface, ExamResults, Profile, Landing).
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Contains global CSS styles for the React application.
    *   **Changes:** Overwritten to implement the initial futuristic dark theme and glassmorphism effects specified in the design requirements.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Provides authentication state and functions (login, logout, register, Google sign-in) to the entire React application via React Context API.
    *   **Changes:** Created to manage user authentication state.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Manages the state related to exam configuration, ongoing exam data, and question generation progress.
    *   **Changes:** Created to encapsulate exam-related logic and state.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** This is the critical interface for students to configure and start their practice exams.
    *   **Changes:** Created to implement the exam configuration UI. Recently updated to show an expected generation time to improve user feedback during question generation.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** The page where students take the actual practice exam.
    *   **Changes:** Created to display questions and manage the exam flow. Updated to show better loading feedback during question generation.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** A reusable component for Google social login.
    *   **Changes:** Created to provide the Google Sign-Up button.

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is in the process of addressing two critical user feedback points:
1.  **EMCET to EAMCET Renaming:** The user explicitly requested to change all instances of EMCET to EAMCET throughout the application. The AI engineer has initiated this task, starting with identifying all occurrences of EMCET across various files. This is a crucial step for brand consistency and accurate exam categorization.
2.  **Google Authentication Fix:** Despite previous attempts, the Google sign-up/login functionality () is still not fully operational. This is a high-priority bug that needs to be resolved to enable seamless student onboarding.

Prior to this, the main focus was on fixing the AI question generation issues. The AI engineer successfully implemented a chunked generation strategy in  to prevent timeouts and ensure all requested questions are generated. This involved adding a progress tracking endpoint and refining the Gemini model initialization. The frontend ( and ) was updated to display real-time loading feedback and expected generation times, which has improved the user experience for the question generation process.
